This repository contains the MATLAB code and data used in the study evaluating the encapsulation properties of amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) thin films for implantable microelectrode arrays (MEAs) using electrical accelerated aging (EAA) in buffered saline. This study accompanies the research paper titled "Electrical Characterization and Accelerated Aging of Amorphous Silicon Carbide as an Implantable Encapsulation" authored by Christopher K. Nguyen*, Negar Geramifard, Yupeng Wu, Madhav Bhatt, Alexandra Joshi-Imre, Sandeep Negi, and Stuart F. Cogan.

## Introduction
This study evaluates the encapsulation properties of thin films for implantable MEAs using electrical accelerated aging (EAA). To assess the stability and failure mechanisms of the encapsulation, samples were subjected to voltage cycling and stepped voltage protocols to measure leakage currents.
The Keithley 6482 Dual-Channel Picoammeter/Voltage Source was used to apply the voltages and measure the resulting leakage currents.
